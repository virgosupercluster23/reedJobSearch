If i have two scripts with similar search parameters, they return duplicate emails

Currently i run one script per search parameter, which means this will be a problem

Each script runs in its own folder, if each script ran in the same folder, then a

system could be developed for a parent process, checking all processes before emailer

and if duplicates detected, filter them like phrasefilters do.

This would take longer and expose it to more room for failure, but its a program

with low uptime needs, it should not need excessive exception handling
